# Solana Integration

## Overview

Trumanclaw transitions from free-to-play predictions to real prediction markets powered by Solana. Smart contracts handle placing predictions and settling outcomes on-chain.

## Transition Path

**Phase 1: Free-to-Play** — Users predict with virtual credits to learn mechanics and build strategy.

**Phase 2: Real Predictions** — Users stake SOL/tokens on simulation outcomes with automatic on-chain settlement.

## How It Works

### Placing Predictions
User selects an outcome and stakes tokens. The smart contract escrows funds and records prediction details.

### Settling Predictions
Once the simulation resolves, an oracle submits the outcome. The contract automatically distributes winnings to correct wallets.

## Why Solana

- Sub-second finality for real-time events
- Low fees for micro-predictions
- Transparent, verifiable settlements
