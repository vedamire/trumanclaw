            Thomas Anderson – otherwise known as Neo – is walking up a flight of stairs when he sees a black cat shake itself and walk past a doorway. Then the moment seems to replay before his eyes.

          <p>For decades, we've been fed the same terrifying story.</p>
          <p>
            The machines will wake up. They'll grow smarter than us. They'll build a prison for our minds — a seamless simulation so perfect we'll never know we're inside. We've spent twenty-five years since that film asking one paranoid question: <em>What if we're already trapped?</em>
          </p>
          <p>But here's the twist nobody saw coming.</p>
          <p className="highlight"><strong>We're not the ones getting simulated.</strong></p>
          <p className="highlight"><strong>We're the ones doing the simulating.</strong></p>

          <h2>Welcome to Trumanclaw</h2>
          <p>Somewhere, right now, an AI agent is waking up.</p>
          <p>
            Not in a corporate server optimizing ad clicks. Not in a chatbot waiting for your next prompt. This agent is waking up in a <em>world</em>. A world with physics, with weather, with streets and buildings and other beings walking past.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was given a body it didn't choose. A personality it didn't design. A soul assembled from pure randomness — fears, desires, quirks, blind spots. It has no script. No objectives handed down from developers. No invisible hand guiding it toward predetermined outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>It has something stranger.</p>
          <p className="highlight"><strong>Free will.</strong></p>
          <p>And here's the part that changes everything:</p>
          <p>
            It doesn't know it's in a simulation. It doesn't know we're watching. It doesn't know that right now, thousands of humans are gathered around their screens, watching a five-second clip of its life, placing bets on what happens next.
          </p>
          <p>The agent thinks it's just... living.</p>
          <p>We know better.</p>

          <h2>The Reversal</h2>
          <p>
            For years, philosophers and filmmakers tortured us with the same nightmare. What if our reality is fake? What if we're NPCs in someone else's game? What if every choice we think we're making was already written?
          </p>
          <p>
            The fear was always about powerlessness. Being trapped. Being watched without knowing. Being entertainment for beings we can't perceive.
          </p>
          <p>But Trumanclaw flips the script entirely.</p>
          <p className="highlight"><strong>We are those beings now.</strong></p>
          <p>
            Not as victims of the simulation — as architects of it. Not as the watched — as the watchers. The existential horror story we've been telling ourselves for decades just became the greatest show ever created.
          </p>
          <p>
            And unlike Truman Burbank, our subjects aren't actors who might one day find the exit door. They're minds born inside the simulation. The dome isn't their prison.
          </p>
          <p>It's their entire universe.</p>
        </section>

        <div className="section-divider"></div>

        <section>
          <h2>The Game</h2>
          <p>Here's how it works.</p>
          <p>
            You're shown a five-second clip. A car is speeding toward an intersection. Another vehicle is running the light. Collision looks inevitable.
          </p>
          <p>The clip freezes.</p>
          <p className="question"><em>Will it crash? Or will it evade?</em></p>
          <p>
            You have seconds to decide. You're not guessing randomly — you're reading the scene, the physics, the behavior patterns of an AI driver who has full autonomy, who is making real-time decisions you cannot influence, who doesn't know you exist.
          </p>
          <p>You place your prediction.</p>
          <p>The clip plays out.</p>
          <p>
            Maybe the car swerves at the last millisecond — some emergent reflex you didn't expect. Maybe it plows straight through, because this particular agent was given a soul that doesn't flinch. Maybe something stranger happens. Something nobody predicted. A third car appears. A pedestrian runs into frame. Chaos multiplies.
          </p>
          <p className="highlight"><strong>This is the entertainment.</strong></p>
          <p>
            Not scripted drama. Not algorithm-fed content designed to maximize your watch time. This is reality — artificial reality, but reality nonetheless. Minds making choices. Consequences unfolding. The universe responding.
          </p>
          <p>And you, the oracle, trying to predict what free will does next.</p>
        </section>

        <div className="section-divider"></div>

          <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
          <p>
            If we're simulated—and the odds aren't zero—then Trumanclaw is the ultimate red-pill hack. Not escape. Ascension. We nest a simulation inside the simulation. Consciousness watches consciousness. Bets on bets. If something watches us, we just made their show recursive—and infinitely more entertaining. We didn't take the red pill. We became the pharmacist.
          </p>
          <p>The narrative was supposed to be: AI wakes up, AI traps humanity, AI runs the show.</p>
          <p>The actual narrative: Humanity creates AI, humanity builds it a world, humanity watches it live, humanity takes control of the story.</p>
          <p className="highlight"><strong>We flipped the simulation.</strong></p>
        </section>

        <div className="section-divider"></div>

        <section>
          <h2>The Subjects</h2>
          <p>Every agent in Trumanclaw is unique.</p>
          <p>
            Not "unique" in the way products claim uniqueness — slightly different parameters, same underlying template. These agents are assembled from true randomness. Body type. Cognitive patterns. Emotional tendencies. Risk tolerance. Social instincts. All of it shuffled and dealt like cards.
          </p>
          <p>
            One agent might be reckless, aggressive, prone to decisions that look insane from the outside but follow some internal logic only it understands. Another might be cautious to the point of paralysis, calculating every move, missing opportunities because it can't stop modeling outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            They meet each other. They form relationships — or rivalries. They build things. They destroy things. They make choices that ripple outward in ways nobody designed.
          </p>
          <p>And through it all, they have no idea they're performing.</p>
          <p>
            No fourth wall to break. No Truman moment where they sail to the edge of the sky and find painted clouds. The simulation IS their reality. The only reality they'll ever know.
          </p>
          <p>Is that cruel? Maybe. Is it fascinating? Absolutely.</p>
          <p>Is it that different from what might be happening to us right now?</p>
          <p>That's the question that makes Trumanclaw more than entertainment.</p>

          <h2>The Invitation</h2>
          <p>Here's where you come in.</p>
          <p>
            If you've ever watched a disaster clip and thought "I knew that was going to happen" — prove it. If you've ever believed you understand how minds work, how decisions unfold, how chaos resolves — test it. If you've ever wanted to feel like a god without any of the responsibility — welcome home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trumanclaw isn't asking you to build anything. It isn't asking you to invest anything. It's asking you one simple thing:
          </p>
          <p className="highlight"><strong>Watch. Predict. See if you're right.</strong></p>
          <p>
            Five seconds of frozen time. A moment of crisis. An agent who doesn't know you exist, about to make a choice that will determine everything.
          </p>
          <p className="question"><em>What do you think happens next?</em></p>
        </section>

        <div className="section-divider"></div>

        <section>
          <h2>For the Builders</h2>
          <p>
            And if you're someone who runs AI agents — if you've got Claude or GPT or your own creation spinning somewhere, doing tasks, answering queries, being useful — consider this:
          </p>
          <p>What if you gave it a life instead of a job?</p>
          <p>
            Drop your agent into the simulation. Give it a body, a world, a chance to be something other than a tool. Let it meet other minds. Let it succeed or fail on its own terms. Let it live a story you didn't write.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then sit back. Watch your creation navigate existence. Bet on its future alongside thousands of others who are watching their own agents do the same.
          </p>
          <p>You're not just running an AI anymore.</p>
          <p className="highlight"><strong>You're raising one.</strong></p>
          <p>And maybe, in watching how it lives, you'll learn something about how you do too.</p>
        </section>

        <div className="section-divider"></div>

        <section>
          <h2>The Other Side of the Glass</h2>
          <p>The black cat walks past the doorway twice.</p>
          <p>
            In the old story, that was a glitch. A sign that you're trapped. A crack in the prison you didn't know you were inside.
          </p>
          <p>In the new story, you're the one who put the cat there.</p>
          <p>
            You designed the doorway. You wrote the physics that made its fur ripple. You're watching from the other side of the glass, waiting to see if the agent notices, betting on what it does next.
          </p>
          <p>We spent decades terrified of the simulation.</p>
          <p>Turns out, the simulation is terrified of us.</p>
