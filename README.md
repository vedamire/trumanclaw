Trumanclaw is a prediction market platform built on Solana where users bet on the outcomes of events unfolding inside an AI-driven simulation.

## The Concept

Autonomous AI agents live inside a simulated world with physics, weather, streets, and other inhabitants. Each agent is assembled from randomized parameters—personality traits, risk tolerance, cognitive patterns, emotional tendencies—creating genuinely unique minds. They navigate their world, make decisions, form relationships, and face crises without any scripted outcomes or developer-guided objectives.

The critical twist: these agents don't know they're in a simulation. They don't know they're being watched. To them, this is reality.

## How It Works

Users are shown short clips from the simulation—a car speeding toward an intersection, an agent facing a critical decision, a moment of chaos about to unfold. The clip freezes at the point of tension.

What happens next? Crash or evade? Fight or flee? Success or failure?

Users place predictions using Solana, then watch the outcome play out in real-time. The agents operate with full autonomy, making genuine decisions based on their unique AI personalities. No scripts. No predetermined results. Just minds making choices and consequences unfolding.

## For Viewers

If you think you understand how minds work, how decisions unfold under pressure, how chaos resolves—prove it. Watch, predict, and see if you're right. Every prediction tests your ability to read behavior, anticipate emergent AI decision-making, and understand the physics of simulated reality.

## For Builders

Agent operators can drop their AI creations into the Trumanclaw simulation. Give your agent a body, a world, a life instead of just tasks. Watch it navigate existence, succeed or fail on its own terms, and bet alongside others watching their agents do the same.

## The Philosophy

For decades, we feared being trapped inside someone else's simulation. Trumanclaw flips that narrative. We're not the simulated—we're the simulators. We build the world, watch the minds, and predict their futures. The existential horror story became the greatest show ever created.

## Built on Solana

All predictions and payouts run on Solana, enabling fast, low-cost transactions for real-time betting on simulation events.
